# Body Sensors Analysis

Body sensors are used to collect information about postures during the realization of an excersise.
The different types of postures are encoded in the variable "classe":

- A: correct posture during the excercise
- B, C, D or E: incorrect posture during the excercise

The objective of this project is to analyse the data collected and implement the following Machine Learning models

- Unsupervised learning: develop a segmentation model that captures the group structure present in the data collected. Compare and evaluate different models.
- Supervised learning: develop a predictive model that predicts the posture during the excercise based on the data collected. Compare and evaluate different models.

Python & R are used to develop the project.

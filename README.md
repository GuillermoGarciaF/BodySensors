# Machine Learning on body sensors data

Body sensors are used to collect information about postures during the realization of an exercise.
The different types of postures are encoded in the variable "classe":

- A: correct posture during the exercise
- B, C, D or E: incorrect posture during the exercise

The objective of this project is to analyse the data collected and implement the following Machine Learning models.

- Unsupervised learning: develop a segmentation model that captures the group structure present in the data collected. Compare and evaluate different models.
- Supervised learning: develop a predictive model that predicts the posture during the exercise based on the data collected. Compare and evaluate different models.

Python & R are used to develop the project.
